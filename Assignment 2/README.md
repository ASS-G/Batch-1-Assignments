  - **Problem 1 (robberThief.py)**
    - Given an amount robbed by a thief ,whoâ€™s aim was to rob more than 20,000, classify the profit of the thief as following:
         - Loss if he has robbed less than `5000`
         - Moderate if it is between `5000` to `19999`
         - Good theft if more than `20000`

    - **Sample Input**
    ```
    Enter the amount robbed by the thief: 9500
    ```
    - **Sample Output**
    ```
    Profit is Moderate
    ```


  - **Problem 2 (occurances.py)**
    - Print the characters in a string along with the number of occurances of those characters.

    - **Sample Input**
      ```
      Enter the String: aabbccddee
      ```
    - **Sample Output**
      ```
      Occurances:
      a -> 2
      b -> 2
      c -> 2
      d -> 2
      e -> 2
      ```


  - **Problem 3 (attendanceStudents.py)**
    - The details of students and their respective attendance
details are given below. Using the concepts of lists and Strings in Python. Print the names of the students who were present
    - The name and their Attendance statuses are separated by "-"
    - `P` stands for Present while `A` stands for Absent

          Ram-P
          Malar-A
          Ahuja-P
          Vijay-P
          Harini-A

    - **Sample Input**
      ```
      Enter your String:
      Leena-P
      Steve-A
      Dinesh-P
      Pragya-P
      ```
    - **Sample Output**
      ```
      The present students were:
      Leena Dinesh Pragya
      ```
