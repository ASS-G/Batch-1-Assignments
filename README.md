FAQ:
======

  #### When should I submit the pull request?
  Just submit it once you're done an assignment.

  #### Fork? Pull request? What is all that? I don't know how to use GitHub!
  If you are new to Git or GitHub, check out this [small tutorial.](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

  #### Where are the rest of the assignments?
  Our code ninjas are hard at work preparing the rest of the problems. Don't worry, they'll be up soon.

  #### How should I complete these programs?
  We have a folder for each assignment. Simply create a folder with your `registration_number` ,  complete your code and move the file into that folder.
  Some examples:
  If your `registration_number` is **180501XXX** submitting `assignment Y` then:
  1. Go to the folder `assignment Y`
  2. Create a folder `180501XXX` inside `assignment Y`
  3. Upload your code in the path `assignment Y\\180501XXX`

  **:no_entry_sign: Please do not modify any existing files in the repository.**

  #### I forked the repository but some problems were added only after that. How do I access those problems?
  Not to worry! Open your nearest terminal or command prompt and navigate over to your forked repository. Enter these commands:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/ASS-G/Batch-1-Assignments.git
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/master
  ```
  If you're curious, the commands simply add a new remote called upstream that is linked to this repository. Then it 'fetches' or retrieves the contents of the repository and attempts to merge it with your progress.
  Note that if you've already added the upstream repository, you don't need to re-add it in the future while fetching the newer questions.

  #### I received a merge error. What do I do?
  This shouldn't happen unless you modify an existing file in the repository. There's a lot of potential troubleshooting that might be needed, but the simplest thing to do is to make a copy of your code outside the repository and then clone it once again. Now repeat the steps from the answer above. Merge it and then add your code. Now proceed as usual. :)

  #### I'm facing difficulties with/need help understanding a particular question.
  Contact one of the board members or open up an [issue](https://github.com/ASS-G/Batch-1-Assignments/issues) on this repository and we'll do our best to help you out.
